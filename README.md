## Version

Release 1.1 created on 2018-12-10 by Frank Hein, maxence operations GmbH, Germany.

This version is based on Zend Service Manager 3.x and is backwards compatible with it.

## Introduction

mxc-servicemanager is a component compatible to [zend-servicemanager  3.x](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-servicemanager "zend-servicemanager"). It can be used to substitute zend-servicemanager 3.x versions.
Different from zend-servicemanager this component does not support PHP 5.6.

For mxc-servicemanager we refactored several parts of zend-servicemanager for better performance. This includes configuration and setup, factory caching and service resolution.

mxc-servicemanager will be kept compatible to zend-servicemanager. Changes to master and develop branches of zend-servicemanager will get merged into mxc-servicemanager as appropriate and applicable.

## Installation

To install mxc-servicemanager:

1. Remove dependencies to zend-servicemanager from your project.

1. Add a dependency to mxc-servicemanager to your composer.json

    ```json
    "require": {
        "mxc-commons/mxc-servicemanager": "^1.1"
    }
    ```

2. Configure PSR-4 compliant autoloading of the namespace Zend\ServiceManager. If you use the recommended way of composer based autoloading, add this configuration to your composer.json

    ```json
    "autoload": {
        "psr-4": {
            "Zend\\ServiceManager\\": "src/"
        }
    },
    ```

3. Run composer update

Now you can use Zend\ServiceManager the way you are used to use it. zend-servicemanager is transparently replaced by mxc-servicemanager. mxc-servicemanager
instances get created by `new Zend\ServiceManager\ServiceManager` as before.
